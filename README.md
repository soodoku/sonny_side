## Sons and Daughters

I estimate bias for sons by examining the extent to which the word son(s) is more common in business names than the word daughter(s). 

Businesses are registered with the state level in the U.S. and most states provide a way to search the data so that new businesses can pick names that haven't been used before. I run searches to estimate how often
